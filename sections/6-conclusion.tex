\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We  have illustrated the reachability based verification results of a reactive planning and control autonomous vehicle that uses Voronoi diagrams for planning and pure-pursuit controller for navigation. 
%Our  safety analysis  relies  on  computing  an  artifact  called reachable set and its fixed point. 
To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first work that considers all three aspects of planning, control, and the dynamically changing waypoint for prove the safety specification.
%
We also demonstrated reactive planning and control technique in various tracks in simulation, and on two physical tracks using a scaled down version of autonomous vehicle. 
%
%While safety aspects of planning have been studied in the literature, 
We believe that the coupled effect of planning and control requires further investigation.
%
In future, we intend to extend this to prove and demonstrate the safety of autonomous vehicles in presence of dynamic obstacles.
%
%The future work includes the system identification of the Traxxas car and implementing the model in Unreal Engine and optimizing the velocity controller. Another dimension to be explored is the safety verification for dynamic obstacles.
