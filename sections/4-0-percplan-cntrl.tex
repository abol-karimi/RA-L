\section{Planning and Control}
\label{sec:percp-plan-control}

In this section we describe our planning and control algorithms which are a variation of  Voronoi-based planning \cite{Das.2011} and geometric control \cite{Snider.2009}.
The safety and progress properties of our algorithms will be formally analyzed and experimentally validated in subsequent sections.
