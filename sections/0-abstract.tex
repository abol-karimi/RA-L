We perform a safety and performance analysis of a \emph{reactive planner and controller} for an autonomous car racing on a circuit.
%
A \emph{reactive planner} operates purely based on the current sensor data to navigate the track.
%
In contrast, a \emph{map-based} planner uses a map, in addition to current sensor data, to localize the vehicle with respect to track boundaries and (static) obstacles.
%
Our reactive planner chooses a path on the Voronoi diagram of the current perception and our controller uses \emph{pure-pursuit} to track the path.
% Reveals identity?
A version of our planner and controller won the Generalized RAcing Intelligence Competition (GRAIC) at CPS-IoT Week.
%
Our safety and performance analysis has two parts.
%
The first part gives sufficient conditions such that the reactive plan is consistent with a non-reactive plan computed from the Voronoi diagram of the full map of the racing track.
%
The second part proves the safety and progress with respect to the non-reactive plan.
%
Therefore, given any map and vehicle for which the sufficient conditions hold, the reactive planner and controller safely complete a lap.
%
The sufficient conditions may be either checked offline using a map of the track, or monitored online by the vehicle using sensor data.
%
As examples, we prove the safety and progress of our reactive planner and controller for five different circuits.
%
In addition, we demonstrate that our implemented planner and controller work well for a wide variety of circuits both in a simulation environment and on a scaled down autonomous vehicle in an office environment.
