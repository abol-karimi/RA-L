In this paper, we perform safety and performance analysis of an autonomous vehicle that implements \emph{reactive planner and controller} for navigating a race lap.
%
Unlike traditional planning algorithms that have access to a map of the environment, reactive planner generates the plan purely based on the current input from sensors.
%
Our reactive planner selects a waypoint on the local Voronoi diagram and we use a pure-pursuit controller to navigate towards the waypoint.
%
Our safety and performance analysis has two parts.
%
The first part demonstrates that the reactive planner computes a plan that is locally consistent with the Voronoi plan computed with full map.
%
The second part involves modeling of the evolution of vehicle navigating along the Voronoi diagram as a hybrid automata.
%
For proving the safety and performance specification, we compute the reachable set of this hybrid automata and employ some enhancements that make this computation easier.
%
We demonstrate that an autonomous vehicle implementing our reactive planner and controller is safe and successfully completes a lap for five different circuits.
%
In addition, we have implemented our planner and controller in a simulation environment as well as a scaled down autonomous vehicle and demonstrate that our planner works well for a wide variety of circuits.
