\subsection{Computer simulations}

We built a virtual environment including various racing circuits in Unreal Engine for testing the planning and control algorithm.
%
Some of these tracks are provided in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_tracks}.
%
The tracks on the left are models of some past  F1/10 competitions \cite{f1tenth}.
%
Other tracks include a triangular track, and a straight track with static obstacles.
%
We have also tested the simulation on some polygonal tracks for which we will provide formal analysis in the subsequent sections.
%
Videos of these simulations are available on the web.\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/ry5xhza}}
%
In all of the nine different tracks, our algorithm was able to successfully complete a lap while not colliding with any of the track boundaries.

The vehicle used in the simulations is the vehicle from Unreal Engine 4.21's `Vehicle Advanced' template project.
%
The default tire friction constants are increased to avoid wheel slippage.
%
We have implemented a model of Hokuyo UST-10LX LiDAR in Unreal Engine.
%
The measurements are taken using Unreal Engine's line tracing.
%
We do not model measurement errors and uncertainty.
