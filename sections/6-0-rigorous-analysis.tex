\section{Rigorous Analysis of Planning and Control Algorithms for Safety and Progress Properties}
\label{sec:rigorous}

In this section we perform rigorous analysis of the Voronoi planning along with pure-pursuit controller.
%
We prove that the vehicle would not hit any of the walls and will successfully complete a lap when its starting position belongs to a defined set of initial states.
%
Our analysis has two parts: the first part is about the properties of the planner and the second part is about the closed loop behavior of the vehicle.
%

In the first part, we prove that the \emph{local Voronoi diagram} computed by the vehicle from its current environment will be consistent with the \emph{global Voronoi diagram} under certain conditions.
%
This consistency ensures that the reactive path planning performed by the robot is equivalent to the path planning performed while having access to the map.
%
The second part of analysis requires computing an artifact called \emph{reachable set} of the closed loop vehicle dynamics.
%
Given a set of initial positions for the vehicle, the reachable set includes all the set of states visited by the trajectories starting from the set.
%
We demonstrate that the reachable set does not overlap with any of the walls and achieves a fixed point after finishing the lap, thus proving the safety and progress properties.
