\subsection{Problem definition}
Consider that an autonomous vehicle is tasked to complete a circuit track without hitting the borders of the track.
Completing the track is a \emph{progress} requirement, and avoiding the track boundaries is a \emph{safety} requirement.
%
Furthermore, the planning and control algorithms are required to be \emph{reactive}: at each time step, steering and speed controls are calculated from the current sensor data only.
%
Assuming that there is no lateral wheel slippage,
we can isolate the problem of finding the steering control from finding the velocity control.
%
This is because if a wheel does not slip laterally, it will move along its direction and so the shape (i.e. footprint) of the trajectory only depends on the steering angle.
%
In other words, the shape of the trajectory is not influenced by the speed, as long as the speed is nonzero.
%
In this paper, we present a simple reactive planner and controller and formally analyze its safety and progress properties.
