\subsection{The system}
The \emph{task} is to drive a car on a circuit track.
%
Finishing one or more laps is a \emph{progress} requirement, and avoiding the track boundaries is a \emph{safety} requirement.
%
The car has four wheels with Ackermann steering.
%
The only sensor available is an on-board LiDAR sensor to measure the environment (i.e. track boundaries).
%
A map of the track is not provided to be used by the planning and control algorithms.
%
There are no static or dynamic obstacles on the track.
%
As discussed in the introduction, perception outputs a set of line segments that approximate the LiDAR data.
